          <span className="uppercase font-bold text-xl">The history</span> of film chronicles the development of a visual art form
          created using film technologies that began in the late 19th century.
          The advent of film as an artistic medium is not clearly defined.
          However, the commercial, public screening of ten of the Lumière
          brothers' short films in Paris on 28 December 1895, can be regarded as
          the breakthrough of projected cinematographic motion pictures. There
          had been earlier cinematographic results and screenings by others,
          like the Skladanowsky brothers, who used their self-made Bioscop to
          display the first moving picture show to a paying audience on 1
          November 1895, in Berlin, but they had neither the quality, financial
          backing, stamina, or luck to find the momentum that propelled the
          cinématographe Lumière into worldwide success. Those earliest films
          were in black and white, under a minute long, without recorded sound,
          and consisted of a single shot from a steady camera. The first decade
          of motion pictures saw film move from a novelty to an established mass
          entertainment industry, with film production companies and studios
          established all over the world.

          Conventions toward a general cinematic language also developed, with
          editing camera movements and other cinematic techniques contributing
          specific roles in the narrative of films.

          Popular new media, including television (mainstream since the 1950s),
          home video (mainstream since the 1980s), and the internet (mainstream
          since the 1990s), influenced the distribution and consumption of
          films. Film production usually responded with content to fit the new
          media, and with technical innovations (including widescreen
          (mainstream since the 1950s), 3D, and 4D film) and more spectacular
          films to keep theatrical screenings attractive.

          Systems that were cheaper and more easily handled (including 8 mm
          film, video, and smartphone cameras) allowed for an increasing number
          of people to create films of varying qualities, for any purpose
          (including home movies and video art). The technical quality was
          usually lower than that of professional movies, but improved with
          digital video and affordable, high-quality digital cameras.

          Improving over time, digital production methods became more and more
          popular during the 1990s, resulting in increasingly realistic visual
          effects and popular feature-length computer animations. <span className="font-bold">Various film
          genres emerged and enjoyed variable degrees of success over time, with
          huge differences among, for instance, horror.</span>
